# Once upon a time

JavaScript was, is and I think will still remain my favorite language for years
to come. I don't exactly know how it came to this but I might remember when this
happened.

This little short post is meant to cover a short little adventure I had starting
from the winter in 2013 up to the spring and early days of summer.

What resulted from that period was what other than a very simple video game
written in JavaScript.

## First steps

When I was finishing up university one of my favorite projects was a game I
built together with a colleague for a Human Computer Interaction Class.

It was something we built using what now might be considered as an ancient
artifact framework called XNA. It was from Microsoft and it allowed you to make
games using C# and we were all over it! 

We used it for many different projects and it was the first environment where I
started learning about some of the basics of game development at the time. This
was probably around 2010-2011.
